        <p>Decorators are one of the most powerful and useful features of Python, allowing you to modify the behavior of functions or classes without changing their source code. In simple terms, decorators are functions that take another function as input and return a new function that extends or modifies the behavior of the original function. They are commonly used for tasks such as logging, caching, authentication, and profiling, and can make your code more readable, efficient, and maintainable. This beginner's guide will introduce you to the concept of decorators in Python, explain how to use them, and provide practical examples to help you understand their power and flexibility. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced Python programmer, decorators are a powerful tool to add to your arsenal.</p>
